@article{2012_minowa_nlp_extract_remarkable_words,
	abstract = {Common factors of accident cause are attempted to extract from accident reports by the statistical analysis.
                   The result from the conventional analysis is difficult to show the factor of accident directly because this analysis classifies a vast description of accident reports into existing classification factors such as ``mistaken operation'' and ``lack of ability''.
                   In this paper, the proposed method reveals common factors in accident report automatically by extracting remarkable factors and grouped accidents. The remarkable factor shows appearance frequency in accident report. The grouped accidents which are evaluated as based on the number of accidents in one group have a characteristic of frequent accident.
                   This paper reports our method was applied to PEC-SAFER accident reports to acquire remarkable factors and similar accident cases.},
